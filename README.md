## Setup

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) it to your machine.



## Inspiration

- Historical examples of visual poetry like  [Gerhard Rühm](https://www.google.com/search?q=Gerhard+R%C3%BChm+concrete+poem), [Augusto de Campos](https://www.google.com/search?q=augusto+de+campos+concrete+poetry), [ Guillaume Apollinaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligrammes), and other works in this collection on [UbuWeb](https://www.ubu.com/vp) 
- [Endless Constellations: On Women in Concrete Poetry 1959–1979](https://www.google.com/search?q=Endless+Constellations%3A+On+Women+in+Concrete+Poetry+1959%E2%80%931979)
- This [Big Data Manifesto](https://molleindustria.org/files/BIG-DATA.html) inspired by Tristan Tzara's [DADA soulève tout](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/184054?artist_id=13398&page=1&sov_referrer=artist) (1921)

## Design

1. Start by looking at examples for inspiration
1. Follow the prompt in Chapter 2 of CWD to select text from a manifesto and create a wireframe for your [concrete poem](https://www.typeroom.eu/article/twenty-things-you-must-know-about-concrete-and-visual-poetry). 
1. Your text and design should somehow reflect on concepts from the "View Source" chapter 
1. Include an image of (or link to) your design in this repository.



## Code

1. Use HTML, CSS, and JS to code your design in `index.html`
1. Style your page with CSS using `<style>` tag or an external stylesheet file. 
1. Use DevTools to inspect your page in the browser and experiment with different CSS rules to control its display. Refer back to your wireframe and the [CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) documentation as needed. See also this [Chrome Dev Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25R1Jl5P7Mw) (11:49) tutorial.
1. Incorporate design choices using focal point and contrast to add context or new meaning to the text in your design. Use the eye movement test often to ensure your layout matches your intentions.
1. Use `console.log()` to show a citation for the quote, poem, or manifesto you selected in the Console. Include the title, author, date, and a link to the original. Finally, log a license for work.
1. See Chapter 2 for more details.



## Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, push, publish, and post all deliverables to Moodle per documentation in the Assignments.





<!-- 
=< 2022 prompts

1. Using an ordered list, write step by step instructions for viewing the source code of a web page in your favorite browser. Include the name of the browser.
1. Using an unordered list, write three other things you can do with the Dev Tools.
1. Invent and add a new unique metaphor for this action (e.g. “Looking under the hood”).
1. Find a website with a secret message in the console or source code (see examples below). Add a screenshot and link to the page with instructions to see the mesage.
1. Using Javascript, add your own secret message for curious users to the console that somehow *reflects on the content of this assignment*. Add your code using either the `script` tag at the end of the document, or link to an external `.js` file. Experiment with different `console` [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console).
1. Add an image of your favorite animal somewhere on the page. -->


<!--
=< 2019 PROMPTS

Explain how your metaphor communicates the act of looking at source code
1. Does it still communicate your experience of being able to look “under the hood” after you now have learned to code?
1. Why is it important to be able to look at the source code of a web page when you are making web pages?
1. Did you look at source code to make something this semester? Write about it.
1. Why is it important to see how things you consume are constructed? What are the larger sociological arguments for transparency? Think about ingredients in the food you eat or chemicals from a factory or how laws are made for example. -->
