    <p>In common with an increasing number of the general public, 
        we have reached a saturation point at which the high pitched 
        scream of consumer selling is no more than sheer noise. We 
        think that there are other things more worth using our skill 
        and experience on. There are signs for streets and buildings, 
        books and periodicals, catalogues, instructional manuals, 
        industrial photography, educational aids, films, television 
        features, scientific and industrial publications and all the 
        other media through which we promote our trade, our education, 
        our culture, and our greater awareness of the world.
